## developer for <a href="https://github.com/mightyinthemidwest/">@mightyinthemidwest</a> by day,<br/><a href="https://onemohrti.me/topics/travel/" target="_blank">traveling</a> designer by night

A bit about me: I’m a full-stack web developer at Mighty, and midnight graphic designer at home in a pandemic; and I’m based out of Grand Rapids, MI. I tend to refer to “about me” as a Designer/Developer, as I am fully versed in the latest front-end specs (even some back-end ones), browser compatibility [meaning, making things appear correctly on IE-anything], and mobile device compatibility. Or to be more specific:

- Markup-related: Twig (Craft CMS, Timber), HTML, PHP
- Style-related: SCSS, LESS, Sass
- Script-related: “vanilla” JavaScript & jQuery
- CMS’s: Craft CMS, WordPress
- As well as Git[Hub] for version control and NPM/Yarn for package management
